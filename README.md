## Current Progress:
- Within _MARL Package_, Run `python SimFire.py` to visualize the active fire
- Within _MARL Package_, Run `python fire_gmm.py` to visualize a single GP fit the sensed fire

## TODO:
- [ ] Think of Sensing model -- IR Sensor w noise for point sensing?
- [ ] Does the agent sense along its path?
- [ ] Reward? Same as ipp-marl for now (weighted map-entropy reduction)?
- [ ] Think of what to communicate, how to process it, noise
